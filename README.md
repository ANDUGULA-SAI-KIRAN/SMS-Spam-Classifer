This project aims to develop a machine-learning model to detect spam messages in SMS text data. It utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques and a supervised learning algorithm to classify SMS messages as either spam or non-spam (ham).

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the "SMS Spam Collection" from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains a collection of 5,574 SMS messages, labeled as spam or ham. 
**The dataset contains two columns:**
label: Indicates whether the message is spam (1) or ham (0).
text: The actual text content of the SMS message.

## Problem Statement: 
In today's technologically advanced world, there is a high likelihood of fraudulent transactions and the dissemination of fraudulent information. One such instance is SMS spam detection. The objective is to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting whether an SMS is spam or not-spam (ham), thereby enhancing the user experience and mitigating the risk of falling victim to spam-related scams.
